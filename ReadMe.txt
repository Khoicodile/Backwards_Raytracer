This is a backwards raytracer application written in python3.
This algorithm generates an image with a large number of light rays.

Within the Raytracer.py class you can change the values using the corresponding constants.
The current resolution is 1000x1000 pixels and the duration of rendering depends on the selected resolution.
The first image has a non-reflective plane.
The second one again has a reflective chest plane.

Command to start:
python3 Raytracer.py
